# Offline Reinforcement Learning on Hopper Environment with IQL

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using the Hopper environment from the MuJoCo suite [Gym MuJoCo documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/mujoco/hopper/),
which is part of the [D4RL library](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL). The [Implicit Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169) (IQL) algorithm has been implemen
ted in PyTorch and tested on the Hopper environment. 
This project also includes logging and experiment tracking using Weights & Biases [(wandb)](https://wandb.ai/home).
