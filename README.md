# Offline Reinforcement Learning on Hopper Environment with IQL

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using the Hopper environment from the MuJoCo suite "https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/mujoco/hopper/,
which is part of the D4RL library. The Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) algorithm has been implemented in PyTorch and tested on the Hopper environment. 
This project also includes logging and experiment tracking using Weights & Biases (wandb).
